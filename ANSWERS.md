### Questions:
1. What is the DOM? The DOM is the document object model. It is the structural body of all aspects of an the HTML file. It is used (predominantly) to allow JavaScript to access and manipulate the items in the HTML file.

2. What is an event? An event occurs when a particular condition is satisfied due to user interaction with the web page. e.g. a user clicks a button, or their cursor enters the body of an element, or a key is pressed or released.

3. What is an event listener? An event listener is a piece of code attached to an element in order to generate a response to a particular event. It "listens" for the event (waits for a condition to be satisfied) and reacts according to the programmer's will.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? Why wouldn't you? Unless you did not want to use array methods on your new array in order to manipulate the items copied from said node list.

5. What is a component? A component is any web page/ui item that utilizes c++ (sorry, css) javascript and HTML for its total functionality.
